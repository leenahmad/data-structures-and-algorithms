# hashmap left join

**Assignment**

***Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.***

#### Feature Tasks

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps
    - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.--
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic


# Approach & Efficiency

- time O(n) 
- space O(n)
